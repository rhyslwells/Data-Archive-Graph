## About

The **Data Archive Explorer** is a local analysis and exploration layer built over a markdown-based knowledge repository called **The Data Archive**.

The system processes the archive as structured data. Markdown notes are parsed, chunked into semantically meaningful units, and indexed using embeddings and metadata. This enables contextual querying across the repository, allowing ideas to be retrieved by meaning rather than exact phrasing. Queries can be scoped by tags, folders, or other metadata, helping to focus exploration on a specific theme or project.

Retrieved notes are presented with surrounding context. The explorer reconstructs local structure by surfacing adjacent sections, related notes, and linked material, making it easier to re-enter lines of thought and understand how ideas are situated within the archive. Related material is grouped dynamically, supporting iterative exploration rather than one-off search.

The explorer exposes structure that emerges over time. It identifies clusters of related notes, recurring concepts, and patterns of linkage within the archive. These structures can be explored as themes or subgraphs, helping to surface connections, overlaps, and areas where synthesis may be missing.

The Data Archive Explorer supports reflective work over accumulated notes. It enables recall of prior thinking, navigation across related ideas, and examination of how concepts develop across time and projects. The archive remains the sole source of knowledge; the tool’s role is to make that knowledge more accessible, connected, and usable during thinking and writing.
