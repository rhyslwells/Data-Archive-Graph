The goal is to analyze and explore the Data Archive using the built JSON file, focusing on note relationships and centrality. This will help in identifying key connections and themes. which can be useful for knowledge management and retrieval.

### Inital data exploration (1-initial.ipynb)
- **Data Structure:** Understand the JSON structure, including notes, tags, and links.

This notebooks is designed to explore initial usage of the JSON file that contains metadata about notes in the Data Archive. 

1. **Data Loading**: Load the JSON file containing metadata about notes in the Data Archive.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the structure and contents of the JSON file to understand the relationships between notes.
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze the relationships between notes and their centrality within the vault.



### **1. Graph-Based Exploration** (2-graph.ipynb)
- **Nodes & Edges:** Treat each note as a node and each link between notes as an edge, creating a graph representation of the vault.
- **Ideas for Exploration:**
  - **Centrality Ranking:** Identify the most interconnected notes.
  - **Clustering:** Group related notes based on shared tags or content similarity.
  - **Path Analysis:** Explore paths between notes to understand how ideas are connected.

### **2. Content-Based Features**
- **Word Count:** Measure the length of notes to prioritize or filter for specific note lengths.
- **Tag Density:** Assess how heavily tagged a note is, useful for filtering highly tagged or under-tagged notes.
- **Link Density:** Count the number of inlinks and outlinks to understand a noteâ€™s connectivity or centrality.


### **3. Semantic Content Mapping**
- **Embeddings/Topics:** Use embeddings or topic modeling to associate notes with broader themes or clusters.
- **Keywords:** Extract key terms from summaries or body text to improve searchability and clustering.


### **4. User-Defined Prioritization**
- **Priority Flag:** Introduce a priority system to mark important or actionable notes, e.g., using tags like #todo or #important for quick identification and filtering.
