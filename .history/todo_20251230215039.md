- [ ] Remember how to use UV with the pyprojects.toml
- [ ] Modify restart\data\manual-polling.py to pull from repo and using git action

- [ ] data\categories_snapshot.json update generator to include:     "outlinks": [],
    "inlinks": [
      "documentation_&_meetings"
    ],
    to-clean-explorations\Data\vault_index.json
    or more like : to-clean-explorations\Data\enhanced_vault_index.json with tf-idf

- [ ] will LDA or TFIDF be useful for this?
