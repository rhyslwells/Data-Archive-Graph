I am investigating a folder of documents. I have created a JSON file where each item is the metadata for a document. I use this JSON to generate a graph.

I am interested in exploring the graph relationships between the notes.

I have used TF-IDF to extract the most important words from each document and added them to the JSON file.

I am looking for ways to explore semantic relationships between the notes.
