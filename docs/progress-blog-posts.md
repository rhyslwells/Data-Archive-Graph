### **1. Graph-Based Exploration** (2-graph.ipynb)
- **Nodes & Edges:** Treat each note as a node and each link between notes as an edge, creating a graph representation of the vault.
- **Ideas for Exploration:**
  - **Centrality Ranking:** Identify the most interconnected notes.
  - **Clustering:** Group related notes based on shared tags or content similarity.
  - **Path Analysis:** Explore paths between notes to understand how ideas are connected.

### **2. Content-Based Features**
- **Word Count:** Measure the length of notes to prioritize or filter for specific note lengths.
- **Tag Density:** Assess how heavily tagged a note is, useful for filtering highly tagged or under-tagged notes.
- **Link Density:** Count the number of inlinks and outlinks to understand a note’s connectivity or centrality.

### **3. Semantic Content Mapping**
- **Embeddings/Topics:** Use embeddings or topic modeling to associate notes with broader themes or clusters.
- **Keywords:** Extract key terms from summaries or body text to improve searchability and clustering.
