    "### 1. **Content Density and Structural Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analyze correlations** between `word_count`, `line_count`, `section_count`, and `max_heading_depth` to understand how structural complexity evolves with length.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Are longer notes more sectionalized (higher `section_count`)?\n",
    "  * Does `max_heading_depth` increase with `word_count` (i.e. are deeper hierarchies used in longer notes)?\n",
    "  * What is the typical line count range for \"complete\" notes?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Plot histograms of `word_count` and `line_count` to find natural breakpoints (e.g. short vs. medium vs. long notes).\n",
    "  * Use pairplots or heatmaps (Seaborn) to visualize correlations among the four core complexity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tagging Strategy and Metadata Standards**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tag count (`tag_count`)** is a good proxy for topical richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > 3 tags is a reasonable threshold for rich categorization. Over-tagging is easier to clean than under-tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Are higher `tag_count` values associated with longer or more detailed notes?\n",
    "  * How many notes have 0 tags, and how do their structural features compare?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Plot a histogram of `tag_count`.\n",
    "  * Scatter plot `tag_count` vs. `word_count` to see if there's a positive relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Frontmatter completeness**: Track `frontmatter_present` alongside `frontmatter_field_count` to assess metadata quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Do notes with more frontmatter fields have more structure or richer formatting?\n",
    "  * Are notes without frontmatter also more likely to be short, empty, or untagged?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bar plot of `frontmatter_field_count`, grouped by `frontmatter_present`.\n",
    "  * Overlay frontmatter usage on tag count or word count distributions.\n",

    "  * Count total image occurrences after regex update.\n",
    "  * Bar plot: notes with vs. without images, split by `word_count` bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tables and code blocks**: Tables appear in a minority of notes, but some (e.g. *naive\\_bayes*) use them heavily. Code is more widespread.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Is table usage associated with data-heavy or reference-style notes?\n",
    "  * How does `code_block_count` vary with `word_count` and `section_count`?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Histograms of `table_count`, `code_block_count`, and `code_block_line_count`.\n",
    "  * Cross-tab of `has_table` vs. `has_code` to find overlap in tabular + code-rich notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quotes and Lists**: Explore how commonly rhetorical devices (`>`) and enumerated content (`-`, `*`) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Are lists or quotes more common in scratchpad or tutorial-style notes?\n",
    "  * Do quote-heavy notes align with conceptual or theoretical notes?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bar chart of `has_quotes` and `has_lists`, annotated with median word counts.\n",
    "  * Word clouds for high-list or high-quote notes to understand themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Note Hygiene and Maintenance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Empty notes**: 144 notes marked `is_empty = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Do empty notes lack tags and frontmatter?\n",
    "  * Are they clustered in certain folders (scratchpads, capture zones)?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pie chart of `is_empty` across note categories (if category field is available).\n",
    "  * Join with file creation time or path metadata to identify abandoned vs. new stubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low-content notes**: Define threshold (e.g. `word_count < 50`) to flag underdeveloped entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Histogram of word count focused on the left tail (<200 words).\n",
    "  * Create a rule-based flag (`is_stub`) for notes needing expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Specialized Content: Math and Technical Depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math usage (`has_math`)** is relatively rare (78 notes), and likely topic-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exploratory questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Are math-heavy notes longer or more structured?\n",
    "  * Are they more likely to have code, tables, or images?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Subset notes with `has_math = True` and analyze their average structural metrics.\n",
    "  * Plot counts of math-heavy notes by tag (if tags include e.g. \"statistics\", \"ML\", \"probability\").\n"
