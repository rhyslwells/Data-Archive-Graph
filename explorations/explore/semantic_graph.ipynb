    "Thank you, that clarifies things. It sounds like you're working with a **semantically annotated graph** where the tags represent *soft* or *semantic groupings*, and you're interested in:\n",

    "1. **Assessing the quality or relevance of existing tags**,  \n",
    "2. **Suggesting better or more consistent tags**, and  \n",

    "## **1. Explore Existing Tags**\n",
    "### A. Tag Frequency & Distribution\n",
    "- Count how many nodes are associated with each tag.\n",
    "- Measure tag co-occurrence: which tags often appear together?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Build a tagâ€“tag co-occurrence matrix (rows and columns are tags, cell values are how often they co-occur).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Tag Purity / Consistency\n",
    "For each tag:\n",
    "- Do the nodes it labels have similar graph structural properties?\n",
    "  - E.g., similar in/out-degree, common neighbors?\n",
    "- Are nodes with the same tag closely connected in the graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric idea**:  \n",
    "For each tag, compute the **average pairwise shortest path** between nodes sharing that tag. Lower values suggest structural closeness.\n",

    "  - **Purity**\n",

    "### B. Embedding the Graph\n",
    "Use `node2vec` or `GraphSAGE` to create embeddings of nodes based on structure.\n",
    "- Cluster embeddings (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN).\n",
    "- Compare those clusters to tags.\n",

    "- Promote tag consistency and reduce noise\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Would you like to:\n",
    "- See code to construct tag co-occurrence and tag distance metrics?\n",
