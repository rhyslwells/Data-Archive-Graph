## About

The **Data Archive Explorer** is a local exploration and analysis tool built to operate directly over a markdown repository called **The Data Archive**.

The application indexes and processes the contents of the repository, enabling querying and related natural language processing tasks across a growing collection of notes. Rather than relying on exact keyword search, it supports contextual retrieval based on semantic similarity, allowing relevant notes to surface even when their original phrasing is forgotten.

In addition to querying, the tool exposes relationships between notes to support tasks such as theme discovery, clustering, and identification of gaps or overlaps within the archive. The repository is treated as a dataset: notes are parsed, chunked, and analysed to make existing knowledge easier to navigate and reuse.

The Data Archive Explorer does not act as an assistant or content generator. It provides an analytical layer over **The Data Archive**, supporting exploration, reflection, and reuse of prior work while leaving authorship and interpretation entirely with the user.
